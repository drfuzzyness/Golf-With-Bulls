# Golf-With-Bulls
Midterm for OART-Game Development: Team Studio

**Puzzle game where you bait bulls into a soccer goal and you're graded on the number of charge it takes** *(think Spanish bull fighting mixed with golf and without any blood)*.

## Mechanical Details:
Youâ€™re in an arena with several bulls (start 1, scale up based on level). You are in third person: WASD to move with relation to the camera and Mouse to look. Space to wave your red flag.  When you wave your red flag, the bulls in arena are enticed by the flag and charge you. When the bull misses, it curves around you and comes to a stop. If you manage to get a bull into the soccer goal, it stops stays in the soccer goal. You win the level when all of the bulls are in the soccer goal.
